            <h1>Project Background</h1>
            My project aims to use restaurant health inspection scores and map the locations on a map with the scores along with the problems/descriptions given that will show why they received that score. The problem at hand is that most food delivery and even Google Maps do not provide the health inspection score for the restaurants, and I believe that this information should be available to the end user so that they can make an informed decision on where to order their food. Ordering and eating food that was prepared in an unsanitary environment can have negative effects on ones health.
            <h1>Relevance</h1>
            New York City is a huge business center that people travel to for work. During a busy work day, some people may want to order food instead of wasting time and going out to eat. Knowing the restaurant health rating is important so that the user knows that their food was prepared in a clean environment and they will not get sick from eating this food.
